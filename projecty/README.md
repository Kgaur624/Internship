The Model-View-Controller (MVC)
It is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components:
the model, the view, and the controller.

now my project is converted into MVC architecture 
like:-
    all the REST endpoints are put into the Resource Package.
    all the business logic of 3rd party implementations are put into Service Package
