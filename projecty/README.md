Simple Logging Facade for Java (abbreviated SLF4J) â€“ 
acts as a facade for different logging frameworks
It offers a generic API making the logging independent of the actual implementation.
This allows for different logging frameworks to coexist. 
It also helps migrate from one framework to another.
